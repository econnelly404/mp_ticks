# Mountain Project Ticks
[Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/) is a website that serves as a community-built guide for rock climbing areas around the globe. The site allows users to track ("tick") each attempt of a route and record various information related to the attempt and the climber's opinion of the route. Mountain Project allows all of a user's ticks to be exported as CSV and downloaded. In `mp_ticks.ipynb`, a data set containing the author's Mountain Project [tick list](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/112173761/eric-connelly/ticks) is cleaned, and various aspects are plotted to better understand the author's current trajectory in climbing as a sport.

Ticks were exported from Mountain Project and saved in CSV format to `ticks.csv`.
